## 💡 About Me
I'm a passionate Machine Learning enthusiast with a knack for solving real-world problems using data.  
Currently pursuing my Master's in **Analytics** at **Northeastern University**, with a specialization in **Applied Machine Intelligence**.  

📘 My academic journey started with a **Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics**. During my undergraduate studies, I was **shortlisted for the final round of the Jignasa Student Study Projects** by the Government of Telangana. Our project focused on simplifying math using tech-driven, intuitive learning approaches — a rewarding experience that strengthened my empathy and love for applied AI in education.  

💼 After graduation, I worked for **2 years as an ML Associate**, building machine learning pipelines, deploying models, and solving practical problems with data-driven insights.  

🧠 My current areas of interest include:
- Deep Learning & Computer Vision  
- NLP & Generative AI  
- Human-Centered AI  
- Interpretable Machine Learning
