## 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate Machine Learning enthusiast with a knack for solving real-world problems using data.  
Currently pursuing my Master's in *Analytics* at *Northeastern University*, with a specialization in **Applied Machine Intelligence**.

📘 My academic journey started with a *Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics*. During my undergraduate studies, I was **shortlisted for the final round of the Jignasa Student Study Projects** by the Government of Telangana. Our project focused on simplifying math using tech‑driven, intuitive learning approaches — a rewarding experience that strengthened my empathy and love for applied AI in education.

💼 After under graduation, I worked for *2 years as an ML Associate*, building machine learning pipelines, deploying models, and solving practical problems with data‑driven insights.
