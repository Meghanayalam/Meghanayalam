## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a data-driven problem solver with a passion for building intelligent systems that matter.  
Currently pursuing my Master's in **Analytics** with a concentration in **Applied Machine Intelligence** at **Northeastern University**.  

With a strong foundation in **Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics**, I’ve worked as an **ML Associate** for 2 years — developing end-to-end ML pipelines, collaborating across teams, and deploying production-ready models.  

🧠 **Focus Areas:**
- Deep Learning & Computer Vision  
- Natural Language Processing & Generative AI  
- Interpretable AI & Human-Centered ML  
- Applied Machine Intelligence in Healthcare & Education
